# Team Profile Generator

## Project Description

This project is a team profile generator using only JavaScript. The user can add and manage employees through the CLI resulting in an HTML page with information on all employees.

## Background

This project is great as it streamlines and simplifies a sometimes very mundane task of adding new employees to a database. It was very interesting to see how I could put some of the code I've learned to practice and create something useful.

## Learnings

I became a lot more comfortable with **inquirer** and with passing in values into functions. I also got to practice template literals a lot more.
 
## Instalation

This project is ran exclusively through the command line. Save the project to your local computer. Navigate inside the **team-profile-generator** folder and install all necessary dependencies by typing: 

```npm i```

After all of the packages are done isntalling, to run the application, type:

```node index```

## Usage

When you run the program, your CLI will present you with a set of questions which you must answer. After answering all of the questions, if the program runs into an error, it will log an error in the console. If everything successfully runs, the console will log a success message and you will see your generated HTML file in the **dist** folder.

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
