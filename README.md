# team-profile-generator

## What is the project?

This project is a team profile generator using only JavaScript.

## Why did I decide to do this project?

This project is great as it streamlines and simplifies a sometimes very mundane task of adding new employees to a database. It was very interesting to see how I could put some of the code I've learned to practice and create something useful.

## What I learned in the process?

I became a lot more comfortable with inquirer and with passing in values into functions. I also got to practice template literals a lot more.

## What makes this project stand out?

This project is a great example of simple yet very effective team profile generator.

## Instalation

This project is ran exclusively in Terminal. Save project to local computer. Navigate your Terminal inside the folder where you've saved this project. Type "node index" in your Terminal and press the Enter button to launch program.

## Usage

This program fully runs inside of Terminal. When you run the program, your Terminal will present you with a set of questions which you must answer. After answering all questions, if the program runs into an error, it will log an error in the console. If everyone runs successfully, the console will log and successful message.
